Web Assessment 19-20 April

I liked being able to put the html and css (especially flexbox) skills into practice. I enjoyed building the website according to the precise specifications given and watching the final product slowly emerge alongside the vision/requirements. 

Towards the end of the project (while I was finishing up the responsive design portion), I had overlooked one error in the code, which I was not able to identify where initially. The whole code was dysfunctional for some time, and I got panicked. I learnt that we can spot errors in VSCode via the 'minimap', and that would have saved me lots of time.

If the gap widths and the card width of the 3rd section had been specified earlier (I did get the memo later when someone asked in the chat).
